Core design based off of [{ Personal } Jekyll theme](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme). The Personal Jekyll theme is Copyright &copy; 2015 Panos Sakkos. The Personal Jekyll theme was made possible by the following :
* [Timeline](https://github.com/kirbyt/timeline-jekyll-theme) (mashup of [Grayscale by Start Bootstrap](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-grayscale) and [Agency Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme))
* Travis CI integration with [html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer)

Syntax highlighting uses the [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) library. highlight.js is Copyright &copy; 2006 Ivan Sagalaev. Custom highlighting(cpp language extensions) for Torque by Jesse Allen.
