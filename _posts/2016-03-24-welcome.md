We are proud to announce the launch of our website and blog! Here we will share news about our projects and blog about indie development. 
We're currently building the site, so please excuse any dust and debris. As the site develops we will also be posting community resources for the open source MIT-licensed game engine Torque3D. 

Although comments are currently disabled, this blog will support Disqus comments in the future. You can add emojis to your posts by typing their [emoji code](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) :wink: (Comments currently disabled)
