Torque3D is a vision. It is an engine unlike any other in that is is driven by its 
community. With no community there is no Torque. Where many may view this as a weakness,
it is indeed Torque's greatest strength. When you have tech that's been developed 
over years of time by a dedicated community, chances are you're going to have a 
strong platform from which to build.

The best part? It's all open source, so regardless of what may or may not be valid 
for a project all of the code can be updated, edited, replaced, or removed altogether 
if need be. The engine is also on the cusp of supporting more modern rendering 
capabilities and an entity/component system. With a polish over file 
structure, extensions, and modules to boot, Torque continues to improve at a steady 
pace. 

It's no secret that Torque's community has been active over the years. Given time and 
dedication, one can sniff out sample scripts or potential code to tackle most of the 
common problems that arise in new projects. More recently, a modern site dedicated to
the Torque3D engine and community was launched at torque3d.org. The site is actively updated 
and maintained, where developers can find all the latest Torque development news or 
join discussions in the community forums.

Implementing common functionality that most users expect from modern games can 
take a bit of work, although any gameplay worth developing should take a bit of 
work. The difference is there is a well thought out, tried and true solution already 
framed up with Torque, ready to be built upon. It's a great boon to the development 
process not to have to code up a base GUI for graphics options or controls, for example. 
Not to overlook the extremely nice built in networking support embedded into Torque's 
source. It's a marvelous bit of tech to be quite honest, passing bits efficiently if 
used correctly and offering a secure server/client architecture. 

So why isn't Torque considered the best of the best by the masses? Plain and simple, 
Torque is not user friendly right out the gate. A new user with no experience or 
close to no experience with the development process will find Torque very difficult 
to approach. Learning Torque's engine-specific script is necessary, which isn't 
overly difficult. Beyond that, though, when it's time to develop core gameplay 
functionality be prepared to alter or create your own classes in C++. While it is true 
almost anything can technically be achieved using only TorqueScript, many resource 
intensive functions are much better implemented in C++(for performance purposes).

In addition, I've mentioned that Torque3D is "on the cusp" of supporting DX11. There 
are other engines that support DX12 already and depending on the project, that could 
be an important factor for the development team to consider. For the indie team or solo 
devs on tight schedules and even tighter budgets, however, chances are pretty high 
many of the updated features from one version of DX to another won't be utilized to 
begin with. 

Compare all of this to other engines maintained by paid teams, with shiny editors, 
and in some cases plug and play modules for purchase. It's easy to see there is a 
difference in what's on offer. One can potentially "develop" a prototype in a single 
weekend by purchasing pre-developed modules, piecing them together like a jigsaw 
puzzle, and calling it a new "game". This is the point in the development cycle that, 
in my firm opinion, Torque pulls ahead of the competition. When a developer goes 
through the motions and ultimately commits to putting in "the hard work" that is 
required to truly create a game they will meet their full potential. While preconfigured 
or pre-developed modules can be useful, if used too liberally a project can be 
doomed to having a cookie-cutter or generic type of feel. More importantly, if a 
developer didn't actually develop anything, debugging problems that arise can be a 
huge can of worms if the project actually reaches a stage where that is important.

So what's to gain from it all? Why work so diligently past Torque's initial learning 
curve? Where is the pile of gold at the end of the rainbow? It is you. It is the sum 
of your experience, your drive and determination, your perseverance, your personal goals 
being achieved, and all of what you have researched and reached out for to better 
your understanding. When you develop using Torque, you will be tested, you will be tried, 
and you will be forced to develop not only your project but yourself. In any given 
project there will be problems that require solving. The sooner you put into practice
the skills required to research new information or logical solutions to problems, 
the sooner you will find success developing any project(using Torque or otherwise). 

Torque is an excellent teacher. Torque will offer just enough functionality to get a 
prototype off the ground, while simultaneously requiring all aspects of a new project 
to work in harmony with one another. What this means, in the long run, is that a 
scripter gets a glimpse into the art and coding world, an artist a glimpse into the 
scripting/coding world, and a coder can achieve a clear understanding of even the 
most complex of Torque's features given enough dedication to researching the open 
source code. Ultimately, investing time into Torque is investing time into yourself. 
If one develops a piece of software with Torque, it is safe to say that individual 
has more than a few admirable qualities and marketable skills. Torque will offer an 
individual insight into unfamiliar areas of development, ultimately expanding his/her 
skillset. 

There comes a time when you grasp what Torque is really offering you as a developer, 
and it's like reaching the summit after a long hike. You can look back over everything 
you have just endured and experienced and truly be proud. Not only of what you have 
achieved, but of yourself for what you have become.
