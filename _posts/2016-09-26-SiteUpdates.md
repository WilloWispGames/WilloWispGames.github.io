We've overhauled our site design and layout. Just about every aspect of the site's design has been updated, from text/background colors to subtle pane 'drifting' animations. Syntax highlighting for our blog has been updated so posted code can take into account Torque-specific input(i.e. color codes work for Torque variables). These highlighting capabilities will continue to be expanded moving forward.

Disqus comments have been enabled! You will now find the Disqus comments area at the bottom of posts that allow comments. You can add emojis to your posts by typing their [emoji code](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) :wink: We look forward to hearing from you!

To fully enjoy the site updates we recommend updating your [java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installation. Disqus requires java, as well as certain visual elements of the site.
