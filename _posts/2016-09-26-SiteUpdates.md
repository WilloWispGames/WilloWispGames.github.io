We've overhauled the site layout. Just about every aspect of the site's design has been updated, from text/background colors to subtle pane 'drifting' animations. 

Disqus comments have been enabled! You will now find the Disqus comments area at the bottom of posts that allow comments. You can add emojis to your posts by typing their [emoji code](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) :wink: We look forward to hearing from you!

To fully enjoy the site updates we recommend updating your [java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)> installation. Disqus requires java, as well as certain visual elements of the site.
