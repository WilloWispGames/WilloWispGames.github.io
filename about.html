## About

Will o' Wisp Games is an indie dev startup currently developing its debut title using the open source game engine Torque 3D. Players can look forward to exploring randomly generated kingdoms in a fantasy themed world, gathering resources used to craft equipment and build.

Although a release date has not been set for the project, much of the game is already playable!
Octocat is Github's logo and trademark and here is used to illustrate a fictional character (John Smith) that used the *{ Personal }* Jekyll Theme to build his website.
