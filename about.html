## About

Will o' Wisp Games is an indie dev startup currently developing its debut title using the open source game engine Torque 3D. We have a passion for creating games that are memorable and engaging, always innovating to improve our standards for excellence. At Will o' Wisp Games we've cultivated our vision over decades of gaming. 

In our upcoming title players can look forward to exploring randomly generated Kingdoms in a fantasy themed world, gathering resources used to craft equipment and build. A true sandbox title to its core, the actions of players will determine what is valuable and who is friend or foe. Every Kingdom will be different, so it will be left up to the players to decide: Who will rule in your Kingdom?

Although a release date has not been set for the project, much of the game is already playable!
