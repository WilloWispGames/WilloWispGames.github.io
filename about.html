## About

Will o' Wisp Games is an indie development startup currently developing its debut title. We have a passion for creating games that are memorable and engaging, and are always innovating to improve our standards for excellence. At Will o' Wisp Games we've cultivated our vision over decades of gaming. 

In our upcoming title, players can look forward to exploring randomly generated Kingdoms in a fantasy themed world. Players will be able to gather resources used to craft equipment and build. A true sandbox title to its core, the actions of players will determine what is valuable and who is friend or foe. Every Kingdom will be different, so it will be left up to the players to decide: Who will rule in your Kingdom?
